Every so often someone will tell you that their computer is “slowing down”, while it may actually be slow it’s not because of the reason they think it is. computers don’t  become slow over time ; software becomes more resource intensive.

# Why this happens

It used to be that each version of an OS would have more demanding requirements but with the advent of regular updates in OSes such as windows 10, each time you update the  system the resource usage creeps up, and the computer feels sluggish.
Of course, if you have a spinning hard drive (HDD), this problem is made worse by the fact that HDDs are inherently slow due to the time it takes to spin up a disk and read data off it. This is why modern PCs have SSDs which are much faster and last longer.

# What to do about it

If you have a computer that runs windows or MacOS sluggishly, try a lightweight GNU/Linux distro. Most Windows users just use it to open Chrome or Firefox, which will usually run faster on linux on slower hardware.
